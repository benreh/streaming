Prerequisits:
=============

Software:
- ffmpeg in a not too old version (tested with 0.11.1)
- wget
- inscape (only for watermark)

Hardware:
- a v4l2 (video for linux 2) compatible camera
- a pulse audio source


How to run it:
==============
Just start the script with
 ./capture.sh
or
 bash capture.sh

but NOT sh capture.sh
(this will fail for some strange reason.
I did not have the time to investigate that any further)

It should now stream the content to the streaming server.


How to view it:
===============
open
  http://www.eurobot.uni-hd.de
in a webbrowser.
Android is not yet working and iOS probably will never work due to the lack of flash support.

Configuration:
==============

There are several parts to configure. For details see the script itself.
Here are just some remarks. 

First the resolution. You should use a not too high but also not too low res.
the default (640x480) seems okay and is supported on most cams.

The fps should stay around 25 or lower due to limited bandwidth.

The Video bitrate now defines the quality. You can play with it.
If you run the script you will see the achieved fps.
If it's not what you set, then you should lower the quality.
If the quality gets to bad before getting a stable fps, lower the fps in the settings.

Watermark
=========

There is an option to include a watermark.
You can switch it on by setting USE_WATERMARK=1
The watermark itsself will be created using the software inkscape.
It is stored in watermark.svg.
After modifying it, you should adjust the document size to the size of your graphics.
This can be done as follows:
* select everything (Ctrl + a)
* File > Document properties
* Resize page to content...
* Resize page to drawing or selection

Converting the svg to png will be done be the capture script automatically
Right now the wateremark is aligned to the lower right corner,
but I hope to make it more flexible soon.


Have Fun!
